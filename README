This is an extension to the first version of the Ros Android Sensors Driver.
It extends the driver to camera readings and updates the previous version to the post-gradle shift of the rosjava libs.
Two compression methods are currently supported, PNG and JPEG (with selectable compression quality).
The topic names are:

 /android/imu
 /android/fix (GPS)
 /camera/camera_info
 /camera/image/compressed


## Compiling:
This project fits into the android_core folder from Indigo branch of https://github.com/rosjava/android_core.

To get an already put together project that will build on Mac OS X:
- `git clone https://github.com/c-h-/android_core`
